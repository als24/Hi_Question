What political journalist, what party whip, would not want to know the\nmakeup of the Whatsapp groups in which Theresa May's enemies are currently lotting? It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns, but the records of which customers have purchased what.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;​Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power. But it is clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow compared to the pace of\nchange within the digital economy. By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace, to be replaced by new abuses of power. But there is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as</p><p><span>presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this</span></p><p>is not obvious when the users of these services don t pay for them. The users of their services are not their customers. That would be the people who buy advertising from them- and Facebook and Google, the two virtual giants, dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;​The product they're selling is data, and we, the users, convert our lives to data or the benefit of the digital giants. Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids<br></p><p>for the honeydew they produce when they feed, so Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield. Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes. It doesn, t feel like a human or democratic relationship, even if both sides benefit.<br></p><p><br></p>",
